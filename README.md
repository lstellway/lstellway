### Hello 👋

My name is Logan and I&rsquo;m a software engineer who is a teacher at heart, striving to grow myself and the people around me. I have experience with a variety of teams in industries including healthcare, automotive finance and retail. I am experienced with mobile and web application development, backend API’s + services, infrastructure, container orchestration and automation. I am a quick learner and enjoy tailoring technology to unique business needs.

#### Technology

At times, working with software is like being a construction worker.<br />
Other times, it is like being a composer: pulling all the right pieces together to create a masterpiece. 

Here are some technologies I work with _(not all-inclusive)_ to give you an idea where I may be able to contribute.<br />
Feel free to [email me](mailto:logan@loganstellway.com) for a resume or to ask about your project! 

_¡También hablo español, si prefieres!_
