### Hello 👋

My name is Logan and I&rsquo;m a software engineer who is a teacher at heart, striving to grow myself and the people around me. I have experience with a variety of teams in industries including healthcare, automotive finance and retail. I am experienced with mobile and web application development, backend API’s + services, infrastructure, container orchestration and automation. I am a quick learner and enjoy tailoring technology to work for humans.

Here are some technologies I work with _(not all-inclusive)_ to give you an idea where I may be able to contribute.
